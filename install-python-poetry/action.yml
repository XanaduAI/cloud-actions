    # This step symlinks the poetry binary to /usr/local/bin/poetry

    # the python binary being used by the calling workflow is not altered.
    # If this step did `echo '/path/to/poetry/bin' >> GITHUB_PATH` .. that /bin would also contain a python
    # binary, and if the calling workflow used python commands after installing poetry, they may use the wrong
    # python binary without knowing it.
    # This avoids that situation by not updating PATH.
